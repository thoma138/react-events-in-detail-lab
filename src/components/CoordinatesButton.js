/*


This component takes in one prop: onReceiveCoordinates. This prop is a function passed down from index.js. 
This function is currently just logging whatever is passed into it.

Within CoordinatesButton, render a button. On click of the button, create an array with two elements: the X and Y coordinates of the mouse. 
Find these using the event data.

Pass this event data in as the argument for the onReceiveCoordinates prop.

If successful, the current x,y position of your mouse should be logged.*/
